computer<->card connection details:

standard ft232 usb serial port

1.25 MBaud
8 databits
odd parity
1 stop bit

protocol is channel+value pairs spread over triple byte clusters

00CC CCCC   01-C CCVV   11VV VVVV

00, 01, 11:  two bit headers identifying the byte in the sequence
C         :  channel data, 0...511 for DMX channels 1...512
V         :  value data 0...255
-         :  don't care

channel = ((inp[0]&0x3F)<<3) | ((inp[1]&0x1C)>>2);
value = ((inp[1]&0x03)<<6) | (inp[2]&0x3F);

The higher transfer speed in the computer<->card interface
is enough to mitigate that more data is sent for each update,
compared to DMX512, even for the worst case scenario, that is,
updating everything, all the time.

Ignoring mark after break and similar things:

DMX512, 1 channel:       10 bits @ 250kBd = 40us
USB transfer, 1 channel: 3*10 bits @ 1.25MBd = 24us
